MMo's experimental Network inventory and monitor

There is nothing serious about this, just the tentative experiment of using non-conventional databases only for a very conventional use, being network monitoring. 

It is an experiment in using neo4j for storing all the parts of the system and using that graph to infer the status or reacheability of elements in the network.
